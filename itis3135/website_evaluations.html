  <section>
    <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple">Apple Website</a></h3>
    <p>Apple's website where they advertise, sell, and inform customers about their products.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contrast: Very well done on this website. There are multiple instances of products being shown on black backgrounds accompanied by very big white text that draws the eye but isn’t too hard on it. The colors are very intentional, with pink/purple hues shown on devices when there is a black background, and blue/orange hues when the background is white.</li>
      <li>Alignment: Almost everything is centered on this website. When things aren’t centered, it’s two equally sized boxes that are the same distance from each other and each margin.</li>
      <li>Repetition: They stick to a common theme of simple geometry. Almost everything is contained in a neat box with clean lines as well as having a consistent color scheme of black/white throughout the whole site.</li>
      <li>Proximity: All elements that make sense being together are together. Information and links related to specific products are placed by images of those products and all header and footer elements make sense where they are.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/">Ling's Cars</a></h3>
    <p>Ling's website where he shows cars they have for sale, information about those cars, and finance options.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contrast: The colors on this page are absolutely terrible. It’s very hard to look at all of the bright colors that don’t go together at all. This goes beyond just not being visually pleasing, this website is genuinely unpleasant to look at.</li>
      <li>Alignment: The alignment is okay for parts of the website. Most images are centered and fill the page well but many logos/images fall outside of zones that they should be in.</li>
      <li>Repetition: The repetition on this page is pretty bad. There is a sidebar next to the content at the top of the page, but eventually the content stops and the sidebar goes all the way to the bottom so you’re looking at a long sidebar next to complete nothing as you scroll down to the bottom. The bottom of the website is plaintext on a white background, completely different from the top of the page that is busy with colors and images.</li>
      <li>Proximity: There’s not much to say here. While information about certain cars is typically near the images of those cars, everything else is all over the place seemingly without reason.</li>
    </ul>

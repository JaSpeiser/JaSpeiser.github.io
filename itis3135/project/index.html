        <p class="text">Board Game Night is an organization founded by Phoenix Chassin in 2023. Phoenix is a passionate
            board game enthusiast who has always loved the idea of bringing people together for an evening of friendly
            competition and fun. In pursuit of his vision, he founded a club called Board Game Night. This club brings
            together people from all walks of life, who share a common interest in board games. Members gather regularly
            to play a wide range of games, from classic favorites like Monopoly and Scrabble to newer games like Settlers
            of Catan and Ticket to Ride.</p>
